# Database Designs

When working with the database designs, make all changes using [master.drawio](./database_designs/master.drawio.png). This draw.io file is the source of truth for all database designs. Each diagram is on a separate page in the draw.io file. The diagram is exported to PNG format and saved in the `./database_designs` directory. The PNG file is then used in the documentation.
